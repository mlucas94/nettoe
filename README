 netToe it is a text based Tic Tac Toe game playable over the Internet.

 You can play it against computer AI, a player on the same machine or
 against another player over the network. (Internet, LAN etc.).

 I think it's best to play it against a friend over Internet while you're 
 chatting with him in IRC or ICQ or something like that.

 Yet nettoe is just a classic Tic Tac Toe game (well yes, it is playable
 over the network ) this is not so good I know. But what I didn't tell you
 is that netToe is going to be enahnced a lot with cool features... 
 
 ( A GUI version of netToe is also in development ).
 
 If you dislike such games but you are interested in C programming,
 or in Socket programming, then you can take a look at the source code.
 
 Well OK let's stop that.

 For information on how to build or install netToe please read the 
 INSTALL file include with the source package.

  

                   -----== [ HOW TO PLAY ]==-----
 

 I think you don't need any information on how to play a Tic Tac Toe game.
 That's why I'm only going to explain how to play nettoe with another
 player over the Internet or a LAN.

 - First decide who will host the game. (you or your friend/opponent)
 
 - Now the one who is going to host the game must (do the following): 
   
     1. run nettoe (Doh)
     2. choose the option 3 (Two players over network) from the Main Menu     
     3. choose the option 1 (Host the Game) from the Network Game Menu
     4. type in his name or nickname (NO BLANK SPACES ALLOWED).
     5. comunicate the IP address to the other player.
        ( hostname also works... if resolved, of course)
        ( I hope you know how to get your IP address...)
     6. Just wait for the other player to connect to your host.     
 
 - Now for the other player (the one who is going to connect to the hosted
   game ):

     1. run nettoe (really ?, Yaeh relly.)
     2. choose the option 3 (Two players over network) from the Main Menu
     3. choose the option 2 (Connect to a host) from the Network Game Menu
     4. type your name or nickname (NO BLANK SPACES ALLOWED).
     5. type in the IP address of the host or the hostname.
        IP address example: 192.168.0.5, ::1
        Hostname example  : myfriend.hostname.com (must be a valid hostname)  
     6. Just wait for the game to start .


 Enjoy. And if you have any problem just let me know.
